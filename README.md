### description of the project :
    Our project aims to rank companies based on how ethical their policies and practices are in regards to human rights, the environment and other criteria affecting consumers. 
    Once complete our website will display a “social good” score not unlike the score shown by rotten tomatoes.com. 
    In this way, companies will be held accountable for their actions, and consumers will have the opportunity to either reward a company who does social good through the purchase of their products, or boycott those who act unethically. 
    Once a user has found a product they intend to purchase from Amazon.com they will post the product link in an input field on our website.  
    We will use this link to find out which company makes this product, and then reference our database, displaying any user submitted rankings or articles related to the practices of the company.

### instructions : 
    Before running the server, to set up, the user will need to install Node express, npm and mongoDB.
