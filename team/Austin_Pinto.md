Hey, my name is Austin Pinto.  I grew up on Cape Cod and I transferred to UMass Amherst in the fall of 2018 to study computer science. 
Prior to taking this course my experience with web development is minimal, however, I am eager to learn more on the topic, specifically in regards to its applications in business and entrepreneurship. I have experience programming in Java, Javascript, Python, and C.
